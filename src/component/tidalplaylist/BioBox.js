        Born Kyrre GÃ¸rvell-Dahll in Singapore and raised across multiple
        continents, the <Cyan>Avicii</Cyan>-inspired producer and DJ started
        playing piano as a child, discovering electronic music as a teen. After
        dropping out of college, he decided to pursue music full time. Signed to
        an international deal with Sony that placed him on RCA in the U.S. and
        Syco in the U.K., he released his first proper single, "Firestone," in
        2014. Featuring lead vocals from <Cyan>Conrad Sewell</Cyan>, the song
        not only went to number one in Norway but reached the Top Ten in several
        other territories. The following year, the Parson James collaboration
        "Stole the Show" was <Cyan>Kygo</Cyan>'s second consecutive solo number
        one hit in Norway. Later that year, "Nothing Left," featuring{" "}
        <Cyan>Will Heard</Cyan>, became his third Norwegian chart-topper.
